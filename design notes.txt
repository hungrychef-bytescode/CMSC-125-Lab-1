## Task Distribution

### Member 1

* Command parsing and tokenization
* Operator detection (`<`, `>`, `>>`, `&`)
* Command data structure design
* Edge case handling for malformed input

### Member 2

* Process creation (`fork()`)
* Command execution (`execvp()`)
* I/O redirection using `open()` and `dup2()`
* Background process handling using `waitpid()`

### Both Members

* System architecture review
* Testing and debugging
* Documentation and README

## Problem Analysis

The shell must:

* Accept interactive user input in a loop
* Distinguish built-in vs external commands
* Execute external programs using POSIX process API
* Support I/O redirection:

  * Input (`<`)
  * Output overwrite (`>`)
  * Output append (`>>`)
* Support background execution (`&`)
* Prevent zombie processes
* Handle file and system call errors properly

### Key Risks

* Incorrect parsing of operators and arguments
* Built-in commands executed in child process
* File descriptor leaks
* Unreaped background processes
* Crashes from malformed input

## Solution Architecture

### Main Components

#### 1. Input Handler

* Reads user input line
* Skips empty input

#### 2. Parser Module

* Tokenizes input by whitespace
* Detects redirection operators and background flag
* Builds `Command` structure containing:

  * command name
  * argument list
  * input file
  * output file
  * append flag
  * background flag

#### 3. Built-in Command Handler

* `cd` using `chdir()`
* `pwd` using `getcwd()`
* `exit` to terminate shell

#### 4. Execution Module

* Creates child process using `fork()`
* Applies redirection using `open()` and `dup2()`
* Executes program using `execvp()`
* Parent waits unless background job

#### 5. Background Job Manager

* Tracks running background processes
* Cleans up completed jobs using `waitpid(..., WNOHANG)`
